# ASP.net-project

ASP.net-project is a visual studio 2010 solution written in ASP.net with C#. Each week I demonstrate a different feature.
The last tab called progres database, pulls data from just that (a postgres database) using linq to entities to display data in table form.


This project will most likely be abandoned and replaced with a visual studio 2013 ASP.net MVC project with more focus.
